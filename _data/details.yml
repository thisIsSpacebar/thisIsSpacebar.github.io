    Permissions such as **iam:ListUsers**, **iam:ListRoles**, **iam:ListPolicies**, **iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies**, **iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies**, **iam:GetRole** and **iam:GetPolicy** are useful across most escalations in order to help determine the permissions your current session is executing with and the potential permissions that could be gained from other users/roles/policies.
